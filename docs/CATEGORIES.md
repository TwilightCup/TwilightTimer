# Tags

> **中文版**: [zh/CATEGORIES.md](zh/CATEGORIES.md)

TwilightTimer has **no category presets**. The active rule set is simply the set of
**tags** (R3) you have enabled — toggle them on the **Category** page of the
settings panel (default key `Home`). Each tag is a rule that decides which
in-game behaviors invalidate a run.

Tags **stack**: enable any combination, and all their rules apply simultaneously.

## Built-in tags

| Tag id | Intent | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| `Checkpoint` (R3.3) | Pass every checkpoint, in order | Skip detection (R4.1) + final-checkpoint validation (R4.2); HUD shows the current checkpoint |
| `NoCheckpoint` (R3.4) | Trigger **no** checkpoint | Invalid if `currentCheckpointNumber > 0` |
| `Jumpless` (R3.5) | Never jump | Invalid on `Human.Localplayer.jump` false→true — and enforced: while the tag is on, the jump key is physically disabled at the game's input layer (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)) |
| `Voiceline` (R3.6) | Trigger every voiceline | Invalid if any `NarrativeBlock` is missed or the Easter voiceline is skipped (see [VOICELINE.md](VOICELINE.md)) |

With no tags enabled (plain Any%), the run is constrained only by the generic
validity checks (R5.1: cheats, speed change, drift) — the HUD shows a red
banner when a run is flagged.

## Enabling tags

In the settings panel's **Category** page, check the tags you want. Changes
take effect immediately and are persisted to `tags.ini` (see [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md))
on panel close / game exit. You can also edit `tags.ini` directly:

```ini
[tags]
enabled = Checkpoint, Jumpless
```

## Adding custom tags

Third-party plugins can register their own tag rules via the `ITagRule` API;
they appear in the same Category page alongside the built-ins. See
[EXTENDING.md](EXTENDING.md).
