# Architecture

> **中文版**: [zh/ARCHITECTURE.md](zh/ARCHITECTURE.md)

This document explains how TwilightTimer is structured and the design decisions
behind it. For the requirements, see [../REQUIREMENTS.md](../REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Guiding principle: poll, don't patch

Almost every signal TwilightTimer needs is a **public field or property** on the
game's classes:

| Signal | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Game state | `Game.state` (`GameState`: Inactive/Paused/LoadingLevel/PlayingLevel) |
| App/network state | `App.state` (`AppSate` — lobby/load transitions) |
| Local/server/client | `NetGame.isLocal`, `NetGame.isServer`, `NetGame.isClient` |
| Current checkpoint | `Game.currentCheckpointNumber` |
| Cheats | `CheatCodes.climbCheat`, `CheatCodes.throwCheat` |
| Jump | `Human.Localplayer.jump` |

Because the timing/segment/reset/checkpoint/validity rules are defined on
*transitions* of these fields, a single polling loop (`TimerCore.FixedUpdate`)
computes everything by comparing the current tick to a cached previous tick —
cheaply, and resilient to game updates that rename or inline private methods.

**Harmony is used only where no field exposes the event**: the two voiceline
hooks (`NarrativeBlock.Play` and `SubtitleManager.PlayNarrative`, see
[VOICELINE.md](VOICELINE.md)), the pause-menu restart hook
(`PauseMenu.RestartClick`, which fires the `restart_clears_forgivable` option),
the Jumpless jump-key suppression (`HumanControls.HandleInput`, R3.5.3), and
the precise timing-boundary hooks (`Game.AfterLoad`, `Game.EnterPassZone`,
`Game.Fall` — R1.11/TB-3).
The last one is a deliberate exception: a pollable field *does* exist
(`HumanControls.jump`), but enforcement is a *write* into a chain the game both
writes and consumes within one physics frame (`NetPlayer.PreFixedUpdate` →
`Human.FixedUpdate`); writing it from this plugin's own `FixedUpdate` would race
on undefined script execution order. Polling covers *observation* — suppression
of an input the game consumes same-frame must hook inside the chain.

The timing-boundary hooks are the same kind of exception for a different
reason: the state flip and the pass detection happen **inside** the game's
physics step, so a poll can only ever observe them on a later tick, and *which*
tick depends on Unity script execution order (BepInEx-added components cannot
set a script execution order). The hooks therefore record the exact tick while
the poll still owns every transition, segment, and reset decision — see
[Pure-tick clock and precise boundaries](#pure-tick-clock-and-precise-boundaries-r111).

## The timing truth table (Appendix B)

Each physics frame (`FixedUpdate`), in order:

1. **Transitions** — compare `state`/`appState` to cached prev:
   - **Segment end (R1.4)**: `PlayingLevel → LoadingLevel`, or `PlayingLevel → Inactive` while local. (Recorded *before* the auto-reset clear.)
   - **Auto-reset (R1.7)**: `Paused→Inactive`, `ServerLoadLobby→ServerLobby`, `ClientLoadLobby→ClientLobby`, or `PlayingLevel→Inactive` (local) — only when `AutoReset` is on.
   - **Segment start (R1.2)**: `LoadingLevel/Inactive → PlayingLevel`, not in a lobby.
   - **Resume from pause (R1.3)**: `Paused → PlayingLevel` while timing was stopped.
2. **Accumulate** — `PlayableTicks += 1` when `PlayingLevel` and not in a lobby / not waiting on the server (R1.11.1). Seconds are never accumulated per frame.
3. **Rules** — run each active category's tag rules' `OnTick`.

`Update` (per render frame) handles: the cheat-code check, the **pause
supplement** (`PauseAccum += unscaledDeltaTime` while `Paused`, since
`timeScale=0` halts `FixedUpdate`), and keybinds.

Pause time is always counted; menu/lobby time is never counted. `LoadingLevel`
and the client-wait gap (`ClientWaitServerLoad`) **never** count either.

### Pure-tick clock and precise boundaries (R1.11)

The engine's game clock is an **integer physics-tick counter**, not a
`double` seconds accumulator:

- `RunState.PlayableTicks` (`ulong`) counts playable `FixedUpdate` frames. Every
  segment snapshot (`SegmentStartTicks`, `LastSegmentTicks`,
  `TotalAtLastSegmentTicks`, `LastRunTicks`, `WakeUpTicks`) is an integer tick.
  Segment duration is the pure integer difference
  `PlayableTicks - SegmentStartTicks`.
- `RunState.PauseAccum` (`double`) is the one non-tick component: pausing halts
  `FixedUpdate`, so it accumulates wall-clock `unscaledDeltaTime` (R1.8.3).
- `Core/GameClock.cs` is the **only** place that reads `Time.fixedDeltaTime`.
  It converts a tick count to seconds with a single multiply
  (`Seconds(ticks, pauseAccum)`), so the same tick count always yields the same
  seconds value (no per-frame float accumulation drift). All display and
  persistence (HUD rows, `t_ms`, PB comparison) convert through it; the engine
  also writes the `RunState.GameTimeSeconds` cache each tick for cheap
  read-only consumers.

**Why the boundary hooks exist.** The game flips `Game.state` to
`PlayingLevel` inside `Game.AfterLoad`, and detects a level pass inside
`Game.Fall` — both while the game's own physics step is executing. A polling
loop can only observe those flips on a later tick, and *which* tick depends on
Unity script execution order, which is why the old code showed a random ±1 tick
at load and at the finish. `Patches/TimingBoundaryPatches.cs` therefore records
the exact tick at the authoritative methods:

| Boundary | Hook | Recorded value |
|---|---|---|
| Segment start (R1.2.2) | `Game.AfterLoad` postfix | `SegmentStartTicks` (consumed by `StartSegment`) |
| Pass flag (R1.4.2) | `Game.EnterPassZone` postfix | `LevelPassed` latch |
| Segment end (R1.4.2) | `Game.Fall` prefix/postfix | `PendingEndTicks` — the exact pass tick |

The `Game.Fall` prefix snapshots whether the call took the pass branch (the
method itself clears `passedLevel` for Workshop/EditorPick before returning);
the postfix latches `PendingEndTicks` and the poll freezes accumulation there.
The hooks only record ticks and set flags — every transition, segment, reset,
and validity decision still goes through the single polling loop, consistent
with the rest of the engine.

### Real Time clock (R1.10)

Separate from the tick game clock, `RunState.RealTime` is a wall-clock timer that starts
on the first playable segment of a run and accumulates with
`Time.unscaledDeltaTime` in `TimerCore.Update` as long as
`RunState.RealTimeActive` is true. Because it is not gated on `PlayingLevel`,
it keeps advancing through `LoadingLevel` screens and pauses. It is stopped (and
the value frozen) in `TimerCore.EndSegment` at the same moment a completed run
is recorded (R1.6), and also stopped when the run exits to a menu or lobby
(unless a retry is in progress) so it does not silently count idle time. Full resets and one-key retries zero it along with the live
game timers. The HUD shows the row by default below Game Time through
`show_real_time`; the clock remains active regardless of that display setting.

## Why retry unloads then re-launches the level

R6.2 requires a **full async level reload**, including the empty transition
scene (R6.2.1.3). TwilightTimer drives it as a coroutine on the engine MonoBehaviour:

1. `Game.instance.UnloadLevel()` tears the running level down — `AfterUnload`
   sets `currentLevelNumber = -1`, `state = Inactive`, clears `currentLevel`
   and `workshopLevel`.
2. `SceneManager.LoadScene("Empty")` loads the empty transition scene.
3. **Dwell** — hold the empty scene until `retry_min_dwell` seconds (default
   0.5) have elapsed since the key press, measured with `Time.unscaledTime`.
   This lets a fast reload breathe; `0` disables the hold. The empty-scene time
   is never counted (the `Retrying` flag suppresses accumulation).
4. `App.instance.LaunchSinglePlayer(level, type, 0, 0)` re-launches the
   **retry-target** level (see R6.4 below — during a menu-entered campaign run
   this is the run's start level, not the current one). Its `LoadLevel`
   coroutine reloads the scene **only when `currentLevelNumber != levelNumber`**
   — so the unload in step 1 is what makes step 4 actually reload. The coroutine
   runs `SignalManager.BeginReset` → reload the scene → `AfterLoad`
   (`state = PlayingLevel`, `RespawnAllPlayers`, `Level.Reset(0, 0)`). No menu is
   shown (the App state machine is the hidden springboard R6.2.1.4 describes).
   Works for BuiltIn, EditorPick, and Workshop levels.

Skip step 1 and re-launching the current level silently degrades into a
checkpoint respawn — exactly the pause-menu "Restart" button behavior, which is
what R6 forbids. This is intentionally **not** `Game.RestartLevel(true)`
(checkpoint respawn, no scene reload) and **not** `Game.ReloadBundle()`
(Workshop-only: dereferences `workshopLevel.dataPath` and crashes on BuiltIn
levels after setting `timeScale = 0`, freezing the game in the "Empty" scene).

This is a level-level restart. A retry re-attempts the current level, so the
live timers (total game time, current segment, and Real Time) reset to zero and
the level is timed from scratch. It is independent of the R1.7 run reset in the
sense that it does **not** clear the run's records (completed
segments, `LastRun`) or validity flags. The reload drives the level through
`PlayingLevel → Inactive → LoadingLevel → PlayingLevel`; to keep that from
looking like a run exit, `RetryAction` zeroes the live tick clock
(`PlayableTicks`/`SegmentStartTicks`) and sets
`RunState.Retrying`, and the engine honors it for the duration of the reload:

- `SegmentLogic.IsAutoReset` suppresses its `PlayingLevel/Paused → Inactive`
  branches while `Retrying` (and the R1.7.3 branch additionally requires
  `App.state == Menu`, which a genuine run exit reaches via
  `PauseLeave → EnterMenu` but a retry never does). So retrying does not clear
  the run even with `AutoReset` on.
- Menu/lobby time is never counted (the fixed-step clock only runs while
  `PlayingLevel`), so the `Inactive` dwell during the reload never adds time.
- `EndSegment` / `StartSegment` skip the LC
  full-run capture, the `LastRun` snapshot, **and the tag `OnLevelExit`
  callbacks** while `Retrying` — the level was abandoned mid-attempt, not
  completed. `OnLevelExit` runs the R4.2 final-checkpoint and the voiceline
  completion checks, so firing them against the abandoned state would spuriously
  raise `INVALID_CHECKPOINT_FINAL` / `Voiceline`. The current level's segment
  still restarts cleanly when the reloaded level reaches `PlayingLevel`.

`Retrying` is cleared on the next segment start and on a full reset.

## Why retry delegates to Level Collections during a collection run

When the Level Collections (LC) plugin is loaded **and** the player is mid-collection-run
(`CollectionManager.IsInCollectionRun`), the one-key retry does **not** reload the current
level in place — it restarts the *whole collection* from level 1 by dispatching LC's own
`lc restart` command through the game's dev-console registry (`Shell.RawInvoke("lc restart")`).
This is `R6.3`.

Restarting a collection re-times the entire run from level 1, so it must take precedence over
the single-level reload. Delegating to `lc restart` (rather than reflecting on LC internals) means
TwilightTimer reuses LC's scene-reload forcing (`ResetCurrentLevelIfSame`), level validation, and
launching — and it works for both config collections and transient (`lc random`) runs. `Shell.RawInvoke`
is the same code path the console uses, so the dispatched command behaves exactly like typing
`lc restart`.

The timer treats this exactly like the single-level retry: it zeroes the live tick clock
(`PlayableTicks`/`SegmentStartTicks`) and
sets `RunState.Retrying` first, so the abandoned level's segment end is not recorded as a `LastRun`
and the reload into level 1 is not mistaken for a run exit — while keeping the run's records and
non-forgivable flags (R6.2.2 independence from R1.7 applies here too). Implementation lives in
`RetryAction.TryExecute` (the LC branch) and `LcIntegration.RestartCollection`.

Two guard cases, both surfaced as `NOTIFY_RETRY_BLOCKED_STATE` without mutating any timer state:
LC refuses a new `lc restart` while one of its delayed commands (`lc restart/skip/random <seconds>`)
is counting down (`IsDelayedCommandPending`), so TwilightTimer refuses too; and if `RestartCollection`
itself returns false (LC absent at call time, run ended), the speculatively-zeroed timers are
restored and TwilightTimer falls back to the single-level reload.

### R6.4 — the campaign "entered from menu" retry target

During a run through the official campaign list (Intro–Reprise) that was **entered
from the menu**, the one-key retry returns to the level the player *started the run
on* (`RunState.CampaignRetryLevel`), not the level they happen to be playing. The
campaign auto-advances on every pass (`PassLevel → StartNextLevel →
LaunchSinglePlayer`), so without this the retry target would drift forward each
level — useless for practicing one chosen level repeatedly.

**Detection — the `Menu → LoadLevel` App-state edge.** The game's own state machine
makes this unambiguous (verified in the decompiled `App.cs`):

- a menu entry goes `App.state: Menu → LoadLevel` (via `LaunchGame`);
- a campaign auto-advance goes `PlayLevel → LoadLevel` — it never passes `Menu`;
- a retry's own reload stays in `LoadLevel` under the `Retrying` flag;
- a multiplayer lobby launch hits `ServerLoadLevel`/`ClientLoadLevel` instead.

So `SegmentLogic.IsMenuEntry(prevApp, nowApp)` fires only on a genuine menu pick.
`TimerCore.HandleTransitions` latches it into `RunState.MenuEntryPending`, and the
next `StartSegment` records the level into `CampaignRetryLevel` — but only when it
is a playable campaign level (`BuiltIn`, `0 <= number < levelCount`, not the
Credits epilogue, not inside an LC collection run, whose retries R6.3 owns).
`MenuEntryPending` is then cleared; the edge only ever describes the level that
just started.

**Persistence.** `CampaignRetryLevel` survives campaign advances (they don't
re-trip the menu edge), full-run resets, and retries themselves — it means "the
level the player last entered from the menu", which stays meaningful until the
next menu entry overwrites it (a new run at a different level). A fresh menu
entry that starts an EditorPick/Workshop/collection level clears it back to -1,
so retry falls back to the current level instead of a stale built-in target.
`MenuEntryPending` is cleared by `RunState.Reset`.

**Retry behavior.** In `RetryAction.TryExecute`, when `CampaignRetryLevel >= 0`
the reload re-launches that level as `BuiltIn` (`NOTIFY_CAMPAIGN_RESTARTED`);
otherwise — EditorPick, Workshop, or any run not tagged as menu-entered — the
current-level reload runs unchanged (`NOTIFY_LEVEL_RESTARTED`). Workshop
current-level reloads use the full `Game.workshopLevel.workshopId` with
`App.LaunchSinglePlayer` so the complete Steam Workshop id is preserved even
though `Game.currentLevelNumber` stores only a truncated `int`. Because a large
Workshop id can truncate to a negative `currentLevelNumber`, the active-level
guard also treats a set `Game.workshopLevel` as an active level; otherwise the
retry key would stop responding after the first Workshop retry. Timing semantics
are identical either way (see R6.2.2 above).

### R6.5 — user-specified retry target

The settings panel's General page has an optional **"Specify retry level"**
override. When enabled, the one-key retry ignores the R6.4/current-level target
selection and re-launches the level named in the associated text field. The
input is either the game's English localized level name for a BuiltIn/EditorPick
level (case-insensitive) or a loaded Steam Workshop numeric id; a numeric value
is always treated as a Workshop id. Resolution uses `WorkshopRepository` plus
the game's English localization table, so it works even when the current game
language is not English.

When no level is active (for example the main menu), a valid override lets the
retry key directly launch the specified level; the normal R6.1.2c "a level must
be active" guard is skipped only in this override case. This makes the feature
usable as a quick level launcher without first entering a level.

If the configured value cannot be resolved, `RetryAction` does not start a
reload, does not touch timers/flags, and sets a transient HUD flag that renders
the same red banner style used for invalid runs. The hint stays until a retry is
pressed with a resolvable value or the option is switched off. During an LC
collection run, R6.3's `lc restart` precedence remains unchanged — the override
is validated (and can show an invalid hint), but an active collection restart
still restarts the whole collection rather than a single specified level.

## Why segment end is recorded before the auto-reset clear

The `PlayingLevel → Inactive` (local) edge is *both* a segment end (R1.4.1) and
an auto-reset trigger (R1.7.3). Recording the final segment and running the
R4.2 final-checkpoint validation must happen before the run is cleared. The
*clock deactivation* on segment end is unconditional; the segment's **values**
(duration / total / completion checks) are recorded only on a genuine
completion (see below). The auto-reset clear is gated by `AutoReset`. See
`SegmentLogic` + `TimerCore.HandleTransitions`.

## Why a segment's values are recorded only on level completion

A level leaving `PlayingLevel` is not always a completion — it can be a mid-level
quit (`Esc → Exit → PauseLeave`), and crucially a **Workshop/EditorPick
completion leaves via the same `PauseLeave` path as a quit**. So the state
transition alone can't tell them apart. `RunState.LevelPassed` is the signal:
each physics tick the engine latches `Game.passedLevel` into `LevelPassed`
(OR'd, so it sticks once the pass zone is reached — the game clears
`passedLevel` itself during the completion/leave flow, before the state flips,
so the latch must read it beforehand). `LevelPassed` is reset on segment start.

`EndSegment(completed: LevelPassed)` records `LastSegmentTicks`/`TotalAtLastSegmentTicks`,
the tag `OnLevelExit` completion checks (R4.2,
voiceline), and the LC last-level `LastRun` capture **only when `completed`**.
A mid-level quit (or a retry, where `LevelPassed` is false) leaves the previous
attempt's `LastSegmentTicks`/`TotalAtLastSegmentTicks` untouched — exactly the desired
behavior: the "last segment" reference reflects the last level you *finished*,
not one you walked out of. Note the `PlayingLevel → LoadingLevel` edge (a
built-in level's `StartNextLevel` reload) is inherently a completion, and there
`LevelPassed` is true from the earlier `EnterPassZone`.

## What counts as a completed run (LastRun)

`LastRun` (the "last run" total) is recorded at the instant a run is *completed*,
and it must distinguish three unrelated endings that the game state alone can't
tell apart. The rule runs in `EndSegment` when `completed` is true, using
segment-start snapshots (because by then the game/LC state has already moved on
to whatever follows):

- **Campaign → Credits**: a BuiltIn level whose number is `levelCount - 1` (the
  last playable level; the game then loads Credits at index `levelCount`).
- **Standalone EditorPick**: an EditorPick level passed *outside* an LC
  collection run (`InCollectionRunSegment` snapshot false).
- **Collection completion**: the last level of an LC collection run
  (`OnCollectionLastLevel` snapshot). Both LC flags are snapshotted at segment
  start, not latched per tick: LC advances `CurrentLevelIndex` synchronously
  inside `Game.Fall`, so when the second-to-last level is passed the index is
  already "last level" during the window before the segment-end edge — a
  per-tick latch would observe that and wrongly fire `RunCompleted` one level
  early (premature `project_complete` in Twilight Cup MULTI rounds). A
  segment-start snapshot keeps the judgment segment-scoped: only a segment that
  *began* as the last level counts. This also covers the true completion edge —
  LC ends the run synchronously inside `Game.Fall` (before the engine's
  FixedUpdate observes the state flip), but the index does not change there, so
  the start snapshot already captured "last level".

(Workshop level passes alone are not a "run completion" — they don't end a run
in the timer's sense.) A prior heuristic that recorded `LastRun` at any segment
start when the clock was running was removed: it fired mid-campaign at every
level boundary and never on EditorPick/Workshop ends, and now `LastRun` updates
only on these genuine completions.

`LastRun` renders in its own column immediately to the right of the timer stack
(not inside it, anchored at the main block's widest line), and only while idle
(`!InSegment && PlayableTicks == 0`) — once a new run starts timing it hides until
the next completion. That same right-hand column can also show the current level's **Wake Up Time**
as its second row (gated by `show_wake_up_time`), so the per-level value stays
visible during a run even when `LastRun` is hidden. By default the measurement
restarts on player respawns, pause-menu checkpoint loads, and pause-menu level
restarts; the `only_record_first_wake_up_time` setting restores the original
level-start-to-first-wake-up behavior. It is cleared when the level ends or is
exited. The one exception is the campaign epilogue: the game loads
Credits (BuiltIn index == `levelCount`) as an ordinary level right after the
final playable level is passed, and that segment is flagged
`InEpilogueSegment` — it belongs to the run that just finished, so the column
stays visible through Credits (and Credits itself never records anything: it
has no pass zone, so its segment never counts as `completed`). Credits listed as
a level inside a collection run does NOT count as the epilogue (the run is still
active — appearing in Credits mid-collection is just an ordinary level), so
`InEpilogueSegment` also requires "not currently in a collection run".

## Why auto-reset and menu entry clear the last-segment snapshots

`LastSegmentTicks` and `TotalAtLastSegmentTicks` are HUD reference values for the most
recent completed segment, while `LastRunTicks` is the last completed run's total.
**Auto-reset (R1.7) clears the live timers and the two last-segment snapshots**,
so leaving to the menu presents a fresh segment baseline, while keeping
`LastRunTicks` as the previous completed-run reference (R1.7.4). The manual reset key
clears all three snapshots (R1.7.1).

`RunState.Reset(bool keepLastValues, bool keepLastRun)` keeps these concerns
separate. The auto-reset and menu-entry paths use
`DoFullReset(keepLastValues: false, keepLastRun: true)`; the manual reset key
uses `DoFullReset(keepLastValues: false, keepLastRun: false)`.

A `Menu → LoadLevel` edge also calls `DoFullReset` before the new segment begins
(R1.7.5), so a run entered from the menu always starts at zero regardless of the
AutoReset option. A retry does not call `Reset`; it zeroes the live timers
through the `Retrying` flag while preserving the run's records.

## Config check & repair

`ConfigRepair.Run(cfg)` runs once in `Plugin.Awake`, right after `ConfigService.Load`
and before any subsystem reads the models. It detects and fills in missing or
incorrect config items. Scalar settings/layout keys already self-heal to defaults
(the parse helpers fall back to the current value), so the rules target collection
fields that `Clear()`-then-rebuild from disk — where a newly-added default item is
silently lost for existing users (this is how the `TotalAtLastSegment` row failed
to appear until this system existed).

Design: **idempotent structural checks every boot, write only when something
changed** (a dirty-gated `ConfigService.SaveSettings`). No config-version key — a
stored version lies when a user hand-edits the file, whereas cheap structural
checks self-heal hand-edited corruption and leave clean files untouched. It logs
one summary line on a repair and is silent on a clean boot.

The first rule, `RepairLayoutRows`, inserts any missing default HUD row when the
user's row set looks default-derived (`IsDefaultDerived`: the rows equal the
defaults in order, minus any missing entries). A reordered or extra/duplicate row
set is treated as hand-customized and left untouched, with an advisory hint. The
canonical default order lives in one place — `LayoutModel.DefaultRows` — shared by
the `Rows` field initializer and the repair target, so the two can't drift; adding
a new default row is a single line there. Adding a new repair concern is one
method plus one entry in the `ConfigRepair.Rules` array.

## Building

```bash
dotnet build src/TwilightTimer/TwilightTimer.csproj
```

`Directory.Build.props` points at the default Steam install's managed DLLs and
BepInEx core. Override `GAME_MANAGED` / `BEPINEX_CORE` for other platforms.


## Twilight Cup match integration (TwilightTimer branch)

The `TwilightTimer` branch hard-depends on TwilightCore (compile-time
reference to its built DLL + BepInDependency) and serves as its timing
engine. Match capabilities live in `Match/` and `TwilightTimerApi` and activate
only inside a match session; local play is unaffected. See
[TWILIGHT_CUP.md](TWILIGHT_CUP.md) for the full behavior, constraints, and
the acceptance-scenario mapping. The integration contract with TwilightCore
(ITimerProvider) is dependency-inverted: TwilightCore owns the interface,
this plugin implements and self-registers it.

`Directory.Build.props` imports an optional, gitignored
`Directory.Build.user.props` that holds machine-local reference paths for the
managed DLLs and BepInEx core. Override `GAME_MANAGED` / `BEPINEX_CORE` for
other machines.

## The Markers module (R10)

Markers follow the same **poll, don't patch** principle as everything else:

- **Triggers are polling.** `MarkersManager.OnPhysicsTick` runs inside
  `TimerCore.FixedUpdate` (right after the subsegment tick) and reads public
  fields only: `Human.Localplayer.transform.position`, `Human.jump`,
  `Human.state`, `Human.Localplayer.GetComponent<GrabManager>().grabbedObjects`,
  `Game.currentCheckpointNumber`, and `RunState.PlayableTicks`/`SegmentStartTicks`
  (converted to segment milliseconds through `GameClock`).
- **The one non-pollable event** is the pause-menu checkpoint load
  (`PauseMenu.LoadClick` → `Game.RestartCheckpoint`), which runs while
  `FixedUpdate` is halted. It is delivered through the *existing*
  `PauseMenuLoadPatch` postfix (no new Harmony class); the pause-menu level
  restart (`PauseMenu.RestartClick`) similarly notifies the manager to clear the
  level's marker records and feed (R10.1.6).
- **PB timing matches R8**: written at level end in `TimerCore.EndSegment`
  before `State.EndSegment` (so the run's reset does not destroy the segment
  start), gated on passed + not-retrying + valid. The tag `OnLevelExit`
  completion checks (final checkpoint / voiceline) run **before** the
  subsegment and marker PB writes, so a run that is only discovered invalid at
  level exit is never recorded as a PB.
- **The leaderboard is shared.** `LeaderboardHud` (renamed from `SubsegmentHud`)
  renders either the subsegment references or the marker feed based on
  `LayoutModel.LeaderboardMode`; the mode-cycle key moved from
  `SubsegmentManager` to the HUD, so the same key and appearance settings work
  for both modes. It cycles hidden → Subsegment → Markers → hidden. Its top
  edge is fixed at the screen center (plus `layout.ini [leaderboard] offset_y`),
  so content extends downward instead of re-centering as the number of rows
  changes. The marker feed is newest-first, format `{name}: {time}` (absolute
  segment time or signed diff vs the marker's PB), with the faster/slower/tie
  colors applied in both time modes (R10.7).
- **Object identity has no GUID in the game.** A captured grab-object reference
  stores the serialized `NetIdentity.sceneId` (unique per scene object within a
  level build) when present, else the hierarchy path from the scene root, plus
  name and world position. Resolution order: sceneId scan → path walk → name +
  position within 5 m (last resort, logged). Unresolvable targets are skipped
  for the attempt with a per-level warning (R10.6.4).
- **Visualization is side-effect free.** `MarkerOverlay` renders range cubes and
  grab-object highlights with `Graphics.DrawMesh` + a transparent unlit material
  (no colliders, no game-object/material mutation, so netcode is unaffected); if
  no shader is found it degrades once to an IMGUI wireframe projection. Labels
  are IMGUI labels projected through the currently active camera: the local
  player's camera when it is enabled, otherwise `Camera.main` (or any enabled
  camera), so free-roam mode shows labels at the free camera's true projected
  positions instead of the character-relative player camera.
