    /// patch ever fail to apply.

    /// Why a patch when the field is pollable (the "poll, don't patch" exception,
    /// see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): suppression is a WRITE into the game's input
    /// chain, not an observation. The game writes <c>controls.jump</c> inside
    /// NetPlayer.PreFixedUpdate → HandleInput and consumes it in
    /// Human.FixedUpdate the same physics frame; writing the field from this
    /// plugin's own FixedUpdate would race on Unity script execution order (our
    /// GameObject is created at runtime, default order group) and could be
    /// overwritten same-frame or land a frame too late. A postfix inside
    /// HandleInput runs synchronously in the game's own call chain, strictly
    /// before any reader — order-safe by construction.
    ///
    /// Scope: jump only. Grab / arm-extend / playDead / fireworks flow through
    /// the same method untouched, and the jump key's secondary role as
    /// pause-menu confirm (HumanControls.ControllerJumpPressed reads the
    /// binding directly) is unaffected. HandleInput is called for every
    /// NetPlayer (local and remote replicas) — the local-player gate ensures
    /// remote players' input is never touched. The tag set is read live on
    /// every jump press (never cached), so panel toggles apply instantly and
    /// there is no state to restore when the tag is turned off. Guarded so a
    /// thrown exception logs instead of crashing the game (N7).
